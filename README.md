Description
-------------------
[WDC standings](https://www.formula1.com/en/results.html/2019/drivers.html) and [qualifying battles](https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.head-to-head-how-2019s-f1-team-mates-compare-at-the-summer-break.YEEBnDYgMTAgsVMT8HCFW.html) are widely documented, but they might not tell the whole story. i.e. DriverA might be faster all weekend, but finish behind DriverB in the race for various reasons.

This project uses data from all seven sessions on every event: FP1, FP2, FP3, Q1, Q2, Q3 and RACE. 

The graphs show the gap to the leader of each session. The fastest time is highlighted to make it easy to visualise which driver was faster.

Data
-------------------
This is an experimental project. It is not real time and it doesn't use any proprietary APIs. It uses only publicly available data from sources such as [motorsport stats](https://results.motorsportstats.com/series/formula-one) and [f1.com](https://www.formula1.com/en/results.html/2019/races/1019/brazil/practice-1.html).
